# About 
As at creating this repository , google is my favorite search engine, I often use it, so much so that I would like to add a personal touch to its look and feel without affecting functionallity..., So came this small extension,\n
Its also a great way to learn about chrome extensions.
The extension is under development and would really use your contribution.
